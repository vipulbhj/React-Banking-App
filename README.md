### Why this exists

The reason I made this repository public is to publically learn new things and improve this codebase consistently. One of the biggest additions to the codebase came recently when [Mr. Kalpesh Singh](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh) very kindly helped the project by adding tests to the project. This was done as a part of this learn in public effort, which you can read more about in the [readme of his fork](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh/exercise-arab).

### How to Setup

First, make sure you have npm and NodeJS installed. You can verify that by checking the version of npm by running the command `npm --version` in your terminal. Once you get that to work, then you can follow the steps below.

* Download the repository locally.
* Open a terminal / command prompt inside the directory(aka folder).
* Run `npm install --save` to install all used dependencies.
* Run `npm start` to start the server.
* Go to `http://localhost:3000`(There is a slight chance, this might be different for you. To verify, look at the output of the last command).

### How to Contribute

This project is open to everyone who wants to contribute to the code, in any / all ways which align with the projects goals mentioned above. Just make a fork, play around with the code, make some changes, imporve the codebase, make a pull request. The project also encourages people to write more code by providing a detailed __code review__, which means that if you make some changes and generate a Pull Request. A proper Code Review would be done to help better the code quality.
