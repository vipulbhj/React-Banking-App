## React Banking App

This repository was created as a part of a frontend developer hiring challenge I did back in early 2019 for Arab Bank. And as you can clear see I was not hired. Less because of my React code, but more for the fact that my code was less maintainable. That was when I first became aware of the fact that writting tests and considering security should be the primary things one should do while writing code.

### Why this exists

The reason I made this repository public is to publically learn new things and improve this codebase consistently. One of the biggest additions to the codebase came recently when [Mr. Kalpesh Singh](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh) very kindly helped the project by adding tests to the project. This was done by him, as a part of the effort he did to apply the skills of testng he was learning in an active and open setting, which in return also helped this project and it's future users a lot. You can real more about this in the [Readme of his fork](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh/exercise-arab).

### How to Setup

First, make sure you have npm and NodeJs installed. You can verify that by checking the version of npm by running the command `npm --version` in your terminal. Once you get that to work, then you can follow the steps below.

* Download the repository locally.
* Open a terminal / command prompt inside the directory(aka folder).
* Run `npm install --save` to install all used dependencies.
* Run `npm start` to start the server.
* Go to `http://localhost:3000`(There is a slight chance, this might be different for you. To verify, look at the output of the last command).

### How to Contribute

This project is open to everyone who wants to contribute to the code, in any / all ways which align with the projects goals mentioned above. Just make a fork, play around with the code, make some changes, imporve the codebase, make a pull request. The project also encourages people to write more code by providing a detailed __code review__, which means that if you make some changes and generate a Pull Request. A proper Code Review would be done to help better the code quality.
